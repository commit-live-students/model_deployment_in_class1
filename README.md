# Model Deployment

What is ML Model Deployment

Scalable inference on the cloud, in a timeframe that allows superior user experience, while being cost-efficient. 

Most of the times, the real use of our Machine Learning model lies at the heart of a product that maybe a small component of an automated mailer system or a chatbot. These are the times when the barriers seem unsurmountable.

For example, majority of ML folks use R / Python for their experiments. But consumer of those ML models would be software engineers who use a completely different stack.


## What we have learnt so far..

- Statistics 
- Building Model

## What you will learn solving this ?

You will learn to deploy your ML model to production. Hosting it to cloud, where other user can use your model for production.



Seems like you are all fired up to put a test to your knowledge.

Let's get started!
